## Wiki Integration

_\[Placeholder\]_

## gluadump

This extension uses the [gluadump](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gluadump) addon to extract some information (e.g. debug.getinfo data for the "View Source" buttons) from Garry's Mod and may need to periodically be updated as new features and libraries are added to Garry's Mod.
