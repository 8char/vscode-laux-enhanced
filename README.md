## Common Issues

#### Where are the file icons?!

Click the Gear icon in the bottom left of VSCode, click "File Icon Theme" and then select GLua.

#### _Auto completion documentation isn't showing up!_

Press `CTRL + Space`

#### _Where did my textual autocompletions go? Your extension broke them!_

[No it didn't](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/21611), see [Recommended Companion Extensions](https://github.com/williamvenner/vscode-glua-enhanced#recommended-companion-extensions)

#### I'm not seeing globals or local variables

You may have the `editor.quickSuggestions` setting set to `false`.

## Bugs/Feature Requests

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/vscode-glua-enhanced/issues) to report bugs and suggest features.

## Recommended Companion Extensions

### [All Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Atishay-Jain.All-Autocomplete)

Mixes textual autocompletions and extension-provided autocompletions, and also includes textual autocompletions from all files in your workspace.

## Wiki Integration

_\[Placeholder\]_

## gluadump

This extension uses the [gluadump](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/gluadump) addon to extract some information (e.g. `debug.getinfo` data for the "View Source" buttons) from Garry's Mod and may need to periodically be updated as new features and libraries are added to Garry's Mod.
